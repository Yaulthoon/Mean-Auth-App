# Mean-Auth-App
Simple app that allows users to register to your database and displays the relevant data underneath the profile page.

## Created by following Brad Traversy's MEAN stack tutorial on YouTube.

### Notes
The original tutorial was written using Angular 2, so some updates were necessary to certain dependencies to convert to Angular 6. If you are having trouble following the series with the current version of Angular, please feel free to reference my files for potential solutions.  Of particular note, angular2-jwt does not function properly for Angular 6, so I needed to use @auth0/angular-jwt instead by importing the appropriate module.
